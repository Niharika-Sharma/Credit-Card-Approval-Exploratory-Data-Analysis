# Credit-Card-Approval-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
A Machine Learning Model to predict if an applicant for a credit card is 'Approved' or 'Not_Approved'.

- As the parameters for approval were not specified, I did an exploratory data analysis on the data, to understand the parameters contributing to the final decision.
- The data set has various Features such as Annual income, Income category, Education level, Marital status, etc, and were divided into two tables which could be merged using the ID.
- After analyzing all the features and selecting the ones having an actual impact on the output. I used Random Forest Classifier to train the model.
